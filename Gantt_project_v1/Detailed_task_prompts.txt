In the create tasks page, I want to perform a conditional checking for end 
date based on holidays. The holidays need to be marked on the dropdown calender,
and after the user inputs the start date and estimate days, the end date should 
be calculated in the backend and shown in the frontend like this: the box for 
end date input should have the calculated end date greyed out, and the user can
also give an end date, but that date should be equal to or after the calculated 
date
Let me give an example, suppose the start date is 9 may 2025, estimate days = 10
so calculated end date = 19 may 2025.So in the end date input box, a suggestion
of 19 may 2025 should be shown greyed out, and the user can select the end date 
but it has to be 19 may or after that.

Now guide me step by step what needs to be done,
 what new api endpoints need to be created in the frontend and backend, and what files will be modified.
 Dont give codes yet
==============================================================================
 Convert the estimate hrs to estimate days in these places:
 1) in the frontend
 2) in the database 
 This is the sql code which i used to create the tasks table and others 
 (attach complete_setup_sql.sql file). And this is the sql code i used to 
 insert dummy data into the table (src/main/resources/insert_codes_gantt_db/tasks_insertions.sql)
Tell me where else modifications will be needed, explain point by point and dont give me code yet
 Now modify their codes and tell me if changes are needed in other tables
 =============================================================================

 Currently there is create tasks page and view tasks page, and in the view tasks 
 page all the tasks are listed. I want to make a hierarchy when creating and listing the tasks.
The hierarchy is like this: There will be epics as the topmost layer, we can add story and task under each epic, and we can add subtasks under each story or task. Like this:

Epic 1
  -Story 1
      -SubTask 1
      -SubTask 2
  -Task 1
      -Subtask 1
      -Subtask 2
Epic 2
      -Story 1
      -SubTask 1
      -SubTask 2
  -Task 1
      -Subtask 1
      -Subtask 2
like this. Now in order to acheive this, I need the following changes to be done.
1) in the View Task Page the display layout should be changed in these ways:
initially in the table all the epics will be listed(the way the tasks are shown now)
When we click on any epic, it will expand like dropdown and all the story or tasks under that epic will 
be shown
 
When we click on any story or subtask, then that will expand in the same way and
show the subtasks under it.
Beside each task or story there should be a dropdown indicator button, using which we can expand or collapse
The layout will be similar to the one shown in this attached image, which is the list view in jira 



2) In the home page, keep the  "View tasks" button,  I want to make a "Create Task" and a  "Create epic" button. So a new form page for creating epics will be needed, which will have some modifications in the form page for creating tasks(taskform.js). Another form page will be for creating subtasks.
3) in the form for creating epics, make these changes to taskform:
- eliminate the type box and sprint box
- Instead of "Task Name/Title" the box label should be "Epic Name/Title"
- eliminate the "parent task" box, instead give a "Linked Epic Name" box in the same position where there'll be a dropdown menu.
In the dropdown menu all the previously created epics will be listed
4) In the new task form, make these new changes:
- in the "Type" box's dropdown menu, show 2 options(Task and Story)
-Eliminate the "Parent task" box
-In case of the "Linked Epic name" box:
	1) if we are creating the task from "Create Task" button in the homepage
	then a dropdown window will be shown from which the user has to select 
	an existing epic (under which the task will be made)
	2) if we are creating the task from +(add task) button under an epic's task listings
	then put the name of that epic fixed inside the box, user cant change it then
5) Subtasks can be created under tasks and stories, by clicking the + button in actions in view page
