Create subtask page er fixes ja ja lagbe:
1) Assignee te dropdown tay oi task er under ee je je user chilo just taader dekhabo
    instead of showing all users 
2) End date er auto calculation which is performed in the create task and create epic 
pages, is absent here
3) subtask er handling tai database ee missing, 2 ways to resolve this:
    -  new subtask table jeikhane each subtask must correspond to an existing task by id 

Create epic page er fixes:
1) In the linked epic name field, inside the dropdown menu, dont list all the epics. 
Rather list all the epics which are part of the project. Suppose project 1 has 4 epics 
and i want to create a 5th epic, so in the Linked epic name field's dropdown, i should see 
the 4 epics of that project only. 
2) for the box "Project", keep it locked to the project we are currently creating the 
epic inside. For example if i try to create a new epic inside project called P1, in the 
project box in create epic page, the value P1 will be fixed and greyed out, i.e. user cant 
change that
3) In the assignees box dropdown menu, show only the users that are assigned to this project
for which we are creating the epic, instead of listing all the users 

Create tasks page er fixes:
1) In the assignees box dropdown menu, show only the users that are assigned to the epic for which 
we are creating the task, instead of listing all the users
